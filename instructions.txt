Frontend Coding Challenge

ThousandEyes Frontend Coding Challenge

For this project, you will be using d3.js (httpd3js.org) to draw the real-time positions of San Francisco's buses and trains (SF Muni).

1. First of all, you will need a base map of San Francisco. This zip file contains a few different versions in GeoJSON format

2. You should draw the vehicle locations on top of the map, dynamically updating their locations every 15 seconds. The instructions for using the real-time data feed are here

Feel free to get creative with how you draw the vehicles, how you transition them to their latest positions, what other data you incorporate besides the coordinates, and so on.

3. Provide a separate HTML control for selecting a subset of routes (the routeTag attribute in the data), e.g. show only N and 6.

Feel free to add any additional controls or interactive elements you think might be useful.

In addition to d3, you are welcome to use any supporting libraries or web frameworks you like, such as AngularJS, React or Angular 2. However, please do not use any non-d3 drawing libraries or out of the box mapping packages such as leaflet.js.

Note that the NextBus server allows AJAX requests from all origins, so you can fetch the data directly from your JavaScript code.

Before submitting your source code, keep in mind that we will be reviewing your submission not just for completeness, but for code quality as well. Design your solution as if you were writing a production application.

We strongly suggest you host the app in the cloud so we can test it easily.
